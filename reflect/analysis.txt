Copy/paste the output of your simulation when using planets.txt,
running the simulation for 1,000,000 (one  million) seconds, and
with a time-step/dt value of 25,000

For some reason after I uploaded the project to get my consle only gets "looking for git in etc..." I will go into TA hours tomorrow to figure out why, but I'm opting to turn this in on time and possibly drop some analysis points due to this

Copy/paste the output of your simulation when using planets.txt,
running the simulation for 2,000,000 (one  million) seconds, and
with a time-step/dt value of 25,000

(replace with copy/paste)

Run the simulation for a billion seconds (10^9) and a time-step/dt
of a million. You should see behavior inconsistent with what is
expected for celestial bodies. This is due to large values of dt
when approximating forces. Write down below what you see during
this simulation.

(replace with observed behavior)
